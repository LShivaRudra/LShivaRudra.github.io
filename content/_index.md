  #             Responsibilities include:

  #             * Built a communication module which transmits keyframe messages across different agents which will be used to solve the Multi-SLAM problem. The keyframes and the odometry form the nodes and edges of the posegraph which is optimized whenever there is a loop closure detected. The communication is done via sockets using TCP protocol.
  #             * Created a 3D map of the lab using point cloud data from the depth camera and rectified odometry from VINS framework. Utilized Voxfield framework for this purpose. 
  #             * Established direct motor control in a drone through the PX4-Autopilot firmware using the uXRCE-DDS middleware and ROS2 framework. This is done both in simulation and in real hardware.
